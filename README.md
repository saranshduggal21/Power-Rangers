# Power-Rangers
This is a text-based game I have created that revolves around the infamous Power Rangers show.
While playing this game, there are many riddles and math questions in order to make the game more interesting. 
During the process of coding this game, I had to efficiently apply my knowledge of Java through methods of nested loops, etc.
I was also able to add my own version of Rock, Paper, Scissors within the game and use loops in order to create virtual objects, all based on user preference (for example, a trident).
Therefore, please refer to the "RPG ANSWER SHEET" for convenience in answering the questions.
For a better user experience, this project has also given me the opportunity to learn how to import music within my programs, in Java.
Please refer to this link: https://bit.ly/2CCjMMr - for the music file (download the file and place it in the same project folder).
